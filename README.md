Watch out for those adaptive levels!

## ✨ Features

- Four themes: spring, autumn, winter, night.
- High scores get stored
- Levels increase in complexity and have adaptive seasonal effects (watch out for the wind gusts in Autumn!)

## 📦 Install

You should hopefully just be able to run it in your browser. If you have python and conda you will need a conda environment with pygame installed.
